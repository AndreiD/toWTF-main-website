          Many DAOs fall into one of two general buckets: <br />Those that
          <strong>manage open source</strong>, blockchain-based projects
          together and those that <strong>make investments</strong>.<br />They
          can act similar to limited liability companies (LLCs), VC firms or
          investment firms, like PleasrDAO. <br /><br />

          But DAOs can be also charities, businesses, social networks, unions or
          political groups.
          <br />
          <br />
          Why DAOs ?
          <br />
          <br />- Inclusive - anyone across the world can join and participate.
          <br />v- Democratic - all decisions may be decided by the community.
          <br />- Transparent - every transaction to and from a DAO is public.
          <br />- Permissionless - DAOs are unregulated and cannot be sanctioned
          by governments.

          <br />
          <br />Why not DAO
          <br />

          <br />Can be complicated - A DAO is a new technology so its
          terminology and user experience can be confusing
